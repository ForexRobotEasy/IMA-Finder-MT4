## Usage

IMA Finder MT4 provides real-time alerts when the moving origin indicator intersects with the price. The moving origin is calculated using the simple moving average (SMA) with the close price as the input. The indicator compares the moving origin with the current price and triggers an alert when they intersect.

To customize the settings of IMA Finder MT4, you can modify the code and add user settings customization functions. You can also optimize your forex trading strategy by implementing strategy optimization functions. Additionally, you can perform other trading operations as required by adding additional trading operation functions.

## Example Code

```mql5
// Initialization function
int OnInit()
{
    // Add necessary indicators and initialize variables
    IndicatorSetString(INDICATOR_SHORTNAME, 'Moving Origin Indicator');

    // Set up real-time alerts
    Alert('Moving Origin Indicator intersects with the price');

    return(INIT_SUCCEEDED);
}

// Start function
void OnStart()
{
    // Get current symbol and timeframe
    string symbol = Symbol();
    ENUM_TIMEFRAMES timeframe = Period();

    // Implement necessary functions to generate signals
    double moving_origin = iMA(NULL, timeframe, 0, MODE_SMA, PRICE_CLOSE, 0);
    double current_price = Close[0];

    // Check if moving origin intersects with the price
    if (moving_origin < current_price && moving_origin > current_price)
    {
        Alert('Moving Origin Indicator intersects with the price');
